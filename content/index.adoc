== Goal of the Lottie4J project

Provide a set of Java libraries that can

* Parse existing Lottie animations to Java objects.
* Generate Lottie files from Java objects.
* Play Lottie animations in JavaFX.
* And achieve this by using a recent Java version with the use of Records to minimize the code and make the project easy to maintain, test, and extend.

There is a Lottie Android project (see https://github.com/LottieFiles/awesome-lottie[awesome-lottie]) but this is aiming for native Android integration, not recent Java versions and/or JavaFX.

== Current status

* Core: can load multiple JSON files, not all yet
* FXPlayer: very basic visualizer
