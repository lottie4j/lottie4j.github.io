== Goal of the Lottie4J project

Provide a set of Java libraries that can

* Parse existing Lottie animations to Java objects.
* Generate Lottie files from Java objects.
* Play Lottie animations in JavaFX.
* And achieve this by using a recent Java version with the use of Records to minimize the code and make the project easy to maintain, test, and extend.

=== 20230206

Based on a https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/commit/28cefb9c8ba59ef420954c39ae9d8ade838d8e90#diff-166d070cf182766be173a83b3675cb8ab2eaac80eea301d965f9af7c455fd3ac[LottieFile with an animation^], created with https://createwithflow.com[Flow^], the Bezier object needed to be extended in two different objects: FixedBezier and AnimatedBezier.

* Core
** Added FixedBezier and AnimatedBezier with BezierDeserializer
** Extended unit tests
* FXPlayer and FXDemo
** Loading of initial test file
** Position, colors, strokes... still to be done

* Core: can already load many different JSON files
** But not all yet...
** To be added to the unit tests and the model needs to be further extended
** See https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/core/src/test/java/com/lottie4j/core/handler/FileLoaderTest.java#L38[FileLoaderTest.java#L38^]
* FXPlayer: very basic visualizer
** Can read a basic Lottie JSON file and draw the paths
** See below with https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/fxdemo/src/main/java/com/lottie4j/fxdemo/DemoApplication.java[DemoApplication.java^] showing the original Lottie on the left, and the very first JavaFX generated image on the right.
