== Goal of the Lottie4J project

Provide a set of Java libraries that can

* Parse existing Lottie animations to Java objects.
* Generate Lottie files from Java objects.
* Play Lottie animations in JavaFX.
* And achieve this by using a recent Java version with the use of Records to minimize the code and make the project easy to maintain, test, and extend.

There is a Lottie Android project (see https://github.com/LottieFiles/awesome-lottie[awesome-lottie]) but this is aiming for native Android integration, not recent Java versions and/or JavaFX.

== Current status on 20230124

* Core: can already load many different JSON files
** But not all yet...
** To be added to the unit tests and the model needs to be further extended
** See https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/core/src/test/java/com/lottie4j/core/handler/FileLoaderTest.java#L38[FileLoaderTest.java#L38]
* FXPlayer: very basic visualizer
** Can read a basic Lottie JSON file and draw the paths
** See below with https://github.com/lottie4j/lottie4j/blob/main/fxdemo/src/main/java/com/lottie4j/fxdemo/DemoApplication.java[DemoApplication.java] showing the original Lottie on the left, and the very first JavaFX generated image on the right.
